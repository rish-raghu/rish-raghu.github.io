Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Princeton University, advised by Professor [Ellen D. Zhong](https://ezlab.princeton.edu/).

I am broadly interested in the application of ML to problems in structural biology. In particular, my research focuses on the 3D reconstruction of dynamic protein structure from cryo-EM and cryo-ET imaging data.

I'm fortunate to have interned at the [Chan Zuckerberg Imaging Institute](https://www.czimaginginstitute.org/) and the [Bhabha+Ekiert Lab](https://be-labs.org/). Previously, I completed my B.S.E. and M.S.E. at Princeton University.
